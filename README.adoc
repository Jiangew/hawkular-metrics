== About

Hawkular Metrics is the metric data store for the http://www.hawkular.org/[Hawkular] project.
It can also be used independently.

It relies on https://cassandra.apache.org/[Apache Cassandra] as a backend and is comprised of:

- a core library
- a REST/HTTP interface

IMPORTANT: Cassandra {cassandra-version} or later is required. It is recommended to use the latest {cassandra-version}.x release if possible.

=== The core library

A Java library, built with https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava[RxJava] on top of the Cassandra Java driver.

This is for advanced users only, if you want to embed the core functionnality in another product.

=== REST/HTTP interface

Most users will work with the
https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular-metrics/tree/master/api/metrics-api-jaxrs[web application].
It exposes a REST/HTTP interface based on the core library. It is implemented with the JAX-RS 2 asynchronous API and
runs on a http://www.wildfly.org/[Wildfly 10] server. The data format is JSON.

== Goals

=== Simple, easy to use REST interface

The http://www.hawkular.org/docs/rest/rest-metrics.html[REST API] should be easy to use. Users should be able to send
data with the simplest tools: shell scripts and `curl`.

== Getting started with a release build

http://wildfly.org/downloads/[Download a Wildfly 10] archive and expand it somewhere on your disk.

Check out the https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular-metrics/releases[Metrics releases] page and download the latest
version of the web application archive: `hawkular-metrics-api-jaxrs-X.Y.Z.war`

Copy this file to the `standalone/deployments` directory of the Wildfly server.

Start the server with `bin/standalone.sh`.

By default, Metrics will try to connect to a Cassandra on localhost. If you want to start a Cassandra server
embedded into Wildfly for testing, add the `hawkular-metrics-embedded-cassandra-ear-X.Y.Z.ear` archive to the
`standalone/deployments` directory.

== Build Instructions

IMPORTANT: A running Cassandra cluster, which can be a single node, is required for unit and integration tests.

[source,bash]
----
git clone git@github.com:hawkular/hawkular-metrics.git
cd hawkular-metrics
mvn install
----

TIP: If you only want to build the sources without a running C* cluster, you can run `mvn install -DskipTests`.

== Setting up Cassandra for development or testing

For development or testing, the easiest way to setup Cassandra is to use the
https://github.com/pcmanus/ccm[Cassandra Cluster Manager, CCM].

[source,bash,subs="attributes"]
----
ccm create -v {cassandra-version} hawkular
ccm populate -n 1
ccm start
----

These steps build and start a single node cluster of Cassandra. Note that while it is recommended to use ccm, it
is not necessary. You just need to make sure you have a running {cassandra-version} cluster.

== Client tools

If you want to send or fetch metrics from your own application, there are client libraries available to assist:

- https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular-client-python[Python]
- https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular-client-go[Go]

== Working with monitoring tools

You can send data collected with your usual monitoring tools to Hawkular Metrics:

- collectd
- ganglia
- jmxtrans
- statsd

In order to do so, you must start our network protocol adapter,
https://github.com/hawkular/hawkular-metrics/tree/master/clients/ptranslator[ptrans].
